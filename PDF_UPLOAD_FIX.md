# üîß PDF Upload Issue - Fix Guide

## Problem

When uploading PDF files through the website, the system shows discrepancies even for matching documents. This is because:

1. **PDF processing libraries were missing** - The OCR module couldn't properly extract text from PDFs
2. **Poppler-utils not installed** - Required for pdf2image to convert PDFs to images for OCR

## Solution

### 1. Install System Dependencies

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install poppler tesseract
```

**Ubuntu/Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils tesseract-ocr
```

**Windows:**
- Download poppler from: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases
- Add to PATH
- Install Tesseract from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 pdf2image
```

These are now included in `requirements.txt`.

### 3. Updated Files

**app/ocr.py** - Enhanced to handle PDFs properly:
- Detects PDF files
- Uses pdf2image + tesseract for scanned PDFs
- Falls back to PyPDF2 for text-based PDFs
- Better error handling

**app/main.py** - Added error checking:
- Validates OCR output
- Returns clear error messages if OCR fails

**requirements.txt** - Added:
- PyPDF2
- pdf2image

## How to Fix Your Setup

### Quick Fix

```bash
# 1. Install poppler (required!)
brew install poppler  # macOS
# or
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils  # Linux

# 2. Install Python packages
pip install PyPDF2 pdf2image

# 3. Restart the application
./start_dev.sh
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check poppler is installed
which pdfinfo

# Should show path like: /usr/local/bin/pdfinfo or /opt/homebrew/bin/pdfinfo
```

## Testing

After installing dependencies:

1. Restart the application: `./start_dev.sh`
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/verify
3. Upload your PO and Invoice PDFs
4. Should now show correct results!

## Alternative: Use Images Instead

If you can't install poppler, convert your PDFs to images:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Convert PDF to PNG
convert -density 300 document.pdf document.png
```

**Online Tools:**
- https://pdf2png.com/
- https://www.ilovepdf.com/pdf_to_jpg

Then upload the PNG/JPG files instead of PDFs.

## What Was Fixed

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå PDFs couldn't be processed properly
- ‚ùå OCR returned garbage text
- ‚ùå Matching documents showed discrepancies

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ PDFs are properly converted to images
- ‚úÖ OCR extracts clean text
- ‚úÖ Matching documents show no discrepancies
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages if libraries missing

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "pdf2image requires poppler"

**Solution:** Install poppler-utils
```bash
brew install poppler  # macOS
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils  # Linux
```

### Error: "pytesseract not found"

**Solution:** Install tesseract
```bash
brew install tesseract  # macOS
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr  # Linux
```

### PDFs still not working

1. Check if PDF is text-based or scanned image
2. Try converting to high-quality PNG (300 DPI)
3. Check backend logs for specific errors
4. Ensure file size is reasonable (< 10MB)

### Low extraction accuracy

1. Ensure PDF quality is good (not blurry)
2. Use 300+ DPI for scanned documents
3. Ensure text is horizontal (not rotated)
4. Try uploading as PNG instead

## Summary

The issue was that the system couldn't properly process PDF files because:
1. PDF processing libraries weren't installed
2. Poppler-utils (system dependency) was missing

After installing these dependencies, PDF uploads will work correctly and matching documents will show no discrepancies.
